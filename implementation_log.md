## Filter Layout Overlap Fix

### Issue Identified
After the initial implementation, the "Shop" filter was overlapping with the "From Date" filter because the first two filter columns were taking too much width.

### Fix Implemented
- **Adjusted Grid Proportions**: Changed from `2fr 2fr 1.5fr 1.5fr 1.5fr 1fr` to `1.6fr 1.6fr 1.2fr 1.2fr 1.3fr 0.8fr`
- **Reduced Gap**: Decreased gap from 16px to 12px for better space utilization
- **Added Medium Screen Breakpoint**: Added 1200px breakpoint for smoother responsive transition
- **Updated Tablet Layout**: Adjusted tablet breakpoint proportions to `1.4fr 1.4fr 1.1fr 1.1fr 1.2fr 0.7fr`

### Results
- ✅ Eliminated overlap between filters
- ✅ All six filters now fit properly on one row
- ✅ Maintained responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- ✅ Preserved visual balance and readability
